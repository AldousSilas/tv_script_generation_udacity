# TV_script_generation_udacity
The `ipynb` file in this `repo` has implemented and passed the requirements for Udacity tv script generation project in deep learning Nano-degree.

## Usage
A RNN was developed from scratch to develop a tv script. Transfer learning techniques have not being used in this project.

## Restrictions

- `cuda` is needed to run most of the code in `ipynb` file as it is highly computation intense.
